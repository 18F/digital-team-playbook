#Digital Services Team Playbook
This is the DRAFT Digital Services Team Playbook.  The Digital Services Team Playbook is intended to provide guidance for others in government who wish to expand their own internal support for modern digital services.  

## 18F Guides Template

This playbook is built on the excellent [18F Guides Teamplate](http://18f.github.io/guides/), which is a
[CFPB/DOCter](https://github.com/CFPB/DOCter)-based
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) template.  You can visit the 18F Guides Template repo to create your own playbook.

You can find the playbook at [https://pages.18f.gov/digital-team-playbook/](https://pages.18f.gov/digital-team-playbook/).
