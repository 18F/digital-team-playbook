As obvious as it may seem, providing the right equipment, development environment or design resources on day one will save numerous wasted hours otherwise spent by new employees on simply finding the tools they need to do their job correctly. In order to make the most effective use of their time, here are some guidelines we’ve come up with that will help get a digital services team up and running in no time.
Office space

You’ll obviously need to allocate office space for your team to use. Remember to plan for the team to expand (as it surely will). The team will sit together, as they’ll be working on the same projects.  Work environments in the private sector vary greatly, but it’s quite likely that many new staff will prove to be pretty flexible given a few broad-based considerations. First, digital services team members work together, so daily communication and cooperation is critical to success. If digital services teams can be physically located together in shared working spaces, this provides flexibility to grow and adapt as the project changes. Physically isolating or distributing all team members across offices or buildings makes it harder for new team members to learn your agency’s culture and communicate with your staff. With that said, it’s distributed teams are common in private industry - so consider establishing a hub first, and then remain flexible as you fill out the rest of your team members.

##Computer equipment

The team will want modern systems and software to be productive, and to demonstrate the digital transformation that can occur with modern capabilities. For development, this usually means Apple Macbooks, which run a variant of the *nix operating system that allows for easy development and design . 

The digital services team also needs the ability to spin up and spin down servers as and when needed, without waiting for weeks for traditional legacy IT delivery practices. Contemporary developments teams are used to doing this in minutes. A popular way to do this is to allow the team to responsibly use a cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services. These capabilities ensures the digital services team can deploy and deliver quickly, and also establishes a model for modern services within the agency 

In government, it can be especially tricky to figure out the best way to procure and secure systems that provide the best tools for your staff, but it can be done. By not allowing outdated and / or restrictive hardware to limit your staff’s ability to work quickly, you’ll save both unnecessary time and frustration. If you become stuck, consider reaching out to an agency who has already stood up a digital services team for guidance.

###Approach
* Devops training workshops can be critical to ensuring a common understanding across your organization. 
* Updating procurement practices to leverage agile delivery.
* Streamlining security and compliance activities to improve their effectiveness within the agency.

##Software and Services
A digital services team needs access to various software and services to perform efficiently and effectively. In the short term, we recommend starting the process of approving and acquiring a few things that the team will surely use. In the long term, ensure that the team has a budget to acquire software and services as they need (in a timely fashion). 

Here are some examples of common tools or platforms that your digital services staff will find useful in their day-to-day work.

####Collaboration Tools
**Github**, a popular web-based repository is used to develop and collaborate code in the open. For more on why that’s important for a digital services team, see this blog post.
**New Relic** (a service that allows your team to monitor servers and applications, providing alerts and insight during errors, excess load etc.) 
**Trello** (a project management tool)
**Adobe Creative Suite and/or Sketch** (wireframe and visual design tools)
**Invision** (prototyping tool that can also capture feedback)

Consider figuring out how to procure these solutions prior to your team starting.   If you get stuck, reach out to an agency who already has a digital services team to learn more about the tools they use.   As an example, 18F uses a script that [automatically loads software](https://github.com/18F/laptop) optimized for team members.

In the long term, establish a simple process for acquiring additional software and services (and allocate the corresponding budget).
