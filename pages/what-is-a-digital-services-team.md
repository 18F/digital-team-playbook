title: What is a digital services team
---
#...and why do you need one?

A digital services team is made up of individuals who empower you to utilize industry standard best practices in meaningful ways across your organization. digital services teams will share many characteristics but are also unique within the agency where they serve. In some agencies they may be built from the ground up - in others, the majority of a team may be existing staff who have been assigned new roles and augmented with new skilled staff. 

All Digital Service Teams are be bound by common goals and core principles, and an unwavering passion to help build effective, user-centric digital services focused on the interaction between government and the external and internal people it serves. In addition, each team will combine expertise across multiple disciplines and embody agile philosophies and practices to transform how the federal government works and delivers services.

Setting up a digital services team simply for the sake of doing so isn’t a good enough reason. Have some early wins for the team deliver in the first year. At first these don’t always have to be the biggest, most challenging problems your agency faces, but they should be ones that are transformative and problems that would have been difficult to address without your team.  Solutions that result in better service for the American people in a short period of time are good for digital services teams; projects that one could easily hand off to a government contractor or not.  A digital services team is not a replacement for government contractors; rather it is a way to augment your services and help you ensure that your IT investments are cohesive, complementary, and are making the most out of your IT funding budget.

##General Approach 
Digital services teams can begin small, with just few dedicated staff members. Working with the agency, the team selects high priority, meaningful projects that help set the stage for establishing long lasting best practices and results that can be easily applied to other high-priority areas. This also helps establish the basis for good recruitment - a strong Digital Services team is cross-functional, combining elements of design, development and operations (devops), and expertise from other subject matters such as security, automation, and procurement.

A digital services team creates a common culture of technical excellence. They’ll use human-centered, open source, open data approaches to reduce costs and provide useful and pleasant interactions across the public, industry, and agencies. 

To understand how a digital services teamoperates, read the following guide (after you’re done reading this one, of course): https://playbook.cio.gov/.  The Digital Services Playbook identifies thirteen key “digital service plays”.  Which are: 

Understand what people need
Address the whole experience, from start to finish
Make it simple and intuitive
Build the service using agile and iterative practices
Structure budgets and contracts to support delivery
Assign one leader and hold that person accountable
Bring in experienced teams
Choose a modern technology stack
Deploy in a flexible hosting environment
Automate testing and deployments
Manage security and privacy through reusable processes
Use data to drive decisions
Default to open

###Case Study: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

Understanding these plays are fundamental to successfully establishing a digital services team.  For the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/), their team was guided largely by these four prevailing principles:

1. Build a diverse team of creatives 
2. Embrace and cultivate a team culture
3. Establish core standards
4. Expand and maximize reach

A founding digital services team will also help recruit new members, growing the team, while simultaneously establishing processes and procedures. When you’re early in the planning phase, consider a few of these as great ways to get started:

##Host a Digital Services Workshop
You may already have a good idea of some of the people within your agency might make for great partners, but do you know them all? Consider hosting an event to  start creating momentum behind the idea of changing the way the agency delivers and manages digital services. If your agency happens to present unusual challenges to doing this yourself, consider finding a partner at 18F or USDS who can help you facilitate and lead such a meeting. Sometimes called Design Studios or Discovery Workshops, these events will help develop a better sense of who your partners in the coming year will be, and help identify existing staff who can make your digital service team a reality.
