The (RFP) Ghostwriting Workshop will bring together key stakeholders from your agency and product, technology,
and acquisition specialists from the 18F team over the course of one to three days to facilitate the rapid development 
of an acquisition strategy and solicitation documents, as well as associated artifacts.

Traditional RFP development inside government can be a painstaking, laborious process, often dragged out over many months,
innumerable meetings, and multi-threaded email exchanges. The 18F RFP ghostwriting workshop compresses that timeline from 
months to days by providing a moderated forum for consulting with program stakeholders to achieve meaningful outcomes in a 
rapid fashion. By working collaboratively with a critical mass of decision-makers, all in one room at the same time, we help 
you remove barriers to delivering the components essential to a successful RFP.

###The goals of the workshop are to:
1. Define and clarify the product vision and key components of a *Performance Work Statement (PWS)* or *Statement of Objectives (SOO)*
2. Adopt a clear acquisition strategy and/or define requirements/constraints
3. Make decisions about key aspects of solicitation
4. Create artifacts that support all the above goals

###Who should attend from my organization?
1. First and foremost, the following individuals are critical to the success of the workshop: 
2. The Product Owner
3. The Contracting Officer (CO)
4. Individuals with approval authority (e.g. CIO’s representative)
5. System Users (to the extent they’re available)

##Sample Agenda
###Day One - Discover
Day One will focus on identifying the product vision, understanding the business processes that inform the product vision, users’ needs, and regulatory and technology constraints that will inform the design and delivery of DIS.

###Day Two - Deliberate
Day Two will focus on refining the goals of the system, identifying opportunities for user delight, clarifying constraints, and defining system boundaries for DIS. 

###Day Three - Decide
Day Three will focus on coalescing around strategy, ensuring completeness, developing artifacts for the solicitation package, and identifying next steps/timelines. 

##Outcomes
By the end of the workshop, the group will have collectively developed artifacts including an acquisition strategy, vision statement, user stories, and other items as reflected in these two documents:

- Statement of Objectives Document
- Evaluation of Criteria Document
