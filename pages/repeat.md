Once you’ve identified and institutionalized successful cycles for hiring and project strategy that works  for your agency’s Digital Service Team, then it’s important to continue to refine and tweak your model until it can be readily replicated. 

Share your findings with other agencies, and learn from the success and failures of your colleagues. Realize that a strategy that works one year isn’t necessarily guaranteed to provide the same results the following year, much less the year after that, given the speed at which technology advances. Continue to test your assumptions, ask new employees for guidance, and refine the process.

Your digital services team also needs to dedicate  time to recruit new members of the team (expanding capacity) as well as engaging with the broader digital coalitions (outreach and participation) that exist within government, as well as public and nonprofit institutions. This is especially important in the early days. Rolling recruitment (so that cohorts of employees overlap) ensures that institutional knowledge is not lost as people move on.
