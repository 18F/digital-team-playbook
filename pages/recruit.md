Individuals attracted to positions on a digital services team are drawn for the same reasons many feel compelled to serve in government - the opportunity to improve our nation  and affect change directly. Clearly stating compelling problems and challenges upfront and illustrating the significant impact that one can have on government, you will help applicants to better understand how they can have a direct impact by joining your team. Well written position descriptions, free of jargon and government-centric views of solutions will help to communicate challenges and opportunities in a way that will help applicants understand how and where best they might be able to apply their skills. It is equally important to find ways to showcase the new approach the team represents, recruiting and branding through non-traditional channels. Failure to adopt a “clean slate” to designing the recruiting experience may result in a lack of faith and buy-in from the broadest pool of candidates.
Create position descriptions

Create position descriptions that describe the important problems the digital services team will solve. The government has  important problems to solve that can have immediate, long-lasting impact, that represent important considerations for applicants. It is also important to outline the organizational commitment behind the team, including support from senior leadership. Although industry may have more flexibility in offering compensation, and a diversity of opportunities, many successful candidates will find the mission of the agency compelling if they are confident that the support and commitment are behind the work. 

For digital services team members, position descriptions should be comparable to those found elsewhere outside of government. One of the challenges of creating a digital services team is creating roles that are recognizable to industry applicants, and care should be given to avoid the perception of “buzzword bingo” that can be commonplace in some government standard practices.  

##Establish a presence on the web

Establish a public facing website (or presence) that describes the vision and impact for the digital services team, and creates a compelling story that invites the broadest pool of qualified applicants to apply for a position. 

Listing the available positions, and providing a link for applicants to submit their information, the site should clearly and concisely outline the mission of the agency, the potential for impact, and humanize the call to service that is inherent behind and digital endeavor. 

###Examples

* [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau] (http://www.consumerfinance.gov/jobs/technology-innovation-fellows/)
* [United States Digital Service] (https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service)
* [Presidential Innovation Fellows] (https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/)
* [Department of Veterans Affairs] (http://www.va.gov/ds/)
* [General Services Administration] (https://18f.gsa.gov/)

##Approach 

As with everything, iteration is key. Initially, start by putting out a minimal version of the website, and expand it later as the concepts and value of the team is further refined: 

For example, consider as a minimal viable product: 

> A single page (maybe even hosted on medium.com) with an email address can suffice initially. 

A second iteration might include: 

> Work on a branding and communication strategy to recruit candidates from industry. Change the perception that government is a boring, bureaucratic place to work. 

The driving force behind a Digital Service Teams should never stop evolving, nor should the story. So it’s important to transition the focus of the digital presence from initial recruitment to sustainment at some phase of the project. This maturation should include the development of more formal and regular outreach channels (social media, blogs, etc) to engage the public and the broader digital community in the critical work being done.
