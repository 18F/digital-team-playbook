A prototype is an interactive mockup of an interface used to describe and test an user’s journey and interaction within a product, site, and/or application. The goal of a prototype is to test the usability and feasibility of current assumptions in a design to better inform the final product. Proptypes of any fidelity can be created using the following techniques and tools: 
- Paper prototypes (wireframes/sketches)
 -Click-through prototypes (InVision, HTML, Keynote, POP App)
 -Protosketching (reference)

####What it is NOT:
- The final product (i.e. a fully functional application)
- A pixel perfect representation of the application
- A pilot/proof of concept to be released to end-users (i.e. a Beta release)

##Purpose
The prototype can be used to support several objectives:
- Validate or debunk current assumptions. Prototypes are a great tool to test hypotheses developed during the discovery phase of a project. Testing prototypes with end-users or internal stakeholders can help the team make a more informed decision about the final design direction.
 -Engage the client/user with the possibilities. A prototype can help stimulate conversations and generate ideas around needs and wants.
 -Generate excitement around capabilities. Often clients whose only exposure to technology engagements is month/year long projects with little/no interaction, a clickable prototype can help change their mindset about what can be done in short periods of time.
- Work through complex user interactions. For clients who can not visualize the interactions through conversation or wireframes, having a clickable prototype can ensure that we are in agreement about the UX/UI.
- Think through use cases. Prototypes can be used to provoke ideas and think more deeply about particular use cases. 
- Keeping projects on course. A prototype can rally people together and make sure they understand the purpose of the sprint and allow people to see the bigger picture.
- Combat planning paralysis. A prototype can help to get people’s attention focused on the product and the user rather than a project plan.
- Supplement requirements. A prototype can help to describe the scope of a project and more clearly define requirements, so that an RFP scope can be better clarified.

When used either tactically or strategically, a prototype is an indispensable tool that can bring people together toward a common goal, cement an idea and bring clarity to a project. 
 
##Best Practices
- Prototypes are throw away. Don’t get vested in a particular version. Prototype are for generating idea, having discussions and iterating until we get the best user interaction.
- Speed over perfection. Modeling out variations and moving the prototype forward is more important than making every pixel perfect. 
- Focus on MVP.  Keep the prototype focused on addressing the core features and interactions.
- Stay Agile. Limit your scope to the current features and don’t get carried away. Things will change. Don’t prototype too far ahead.
