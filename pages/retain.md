Critical to the success of any digital services team is the ability to retain talent once you’ve attracted it. The median tenure amongst workers in the private sector is roughly half that of Federal employees (4.1 years vs. 8.5 years, Bureau of Labor Statistics). Tenure in business and technical sectors tends to be even lower. Therefore it’s particularly important that employees are working on projects that are likely to have meaningful, immediate impact and that can be completed in months as opposed to years. In addition, agencies should consider how to institutionalize the call to service so that expertise can be transitioned to new members of the digital services team, and not lost as a single class transitions out from their term-limited appointments
