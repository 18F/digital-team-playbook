**Improve hiring time.** Select candidates will not always be in a position to wait months before starting work. In order to be competitive, it’s critical that the time between application, interview, offer and start date be significantly reduced. So it’s important to shorten the time between recruitment and onboarding as much as possible. Weeks, not months is an acceptable time frame. 

If you find shortening the onboarding process significantly challenging at your agency, there are some options that may make the process a little less painful.

##Authorities
**Hiring authorities.** There are several hiring authorities that you can use, which have been successfully used at other agencies. The following table outlines only a few of these options, and it is important to work collaboratively with human capital representatives to determine the best course(s) of action.

##Compensation

Most digital teams are hired at the highest levels for an agency (e.g. GS-14/15). This is critical because some members may take a pay cut to serve in the government.

###Approach

In advance, figure out the following: 

* What challenges exist within your organization around creating a team that is mostly comprised of GS-15s (or equivalent)? What are the options to overcome these challenges? 
* What level of leadership will the digital services team engage with, and ensure they represent similar senior levels to ensure recognition of their role and promote successful dialogue.

##Working with a remote team
Consider allowing members of your digital services team to live away from Washington DC. This makes recruitment easier as many digital professionals may be unwilling to move away from the lives and homes they have established, especially given the fact that most digital service teams are term-limited commitments. Both 18F and CFPB have proved that this model works successfully, however also be transparent in the need for some physical presence and plan for travel and tools (e.g. remote conferencing) as necessary. 

###Approach
 
In advance, figure out the following: 

Ensure that there is a policy that allows them to have duty station away from an established office. 
Ensure that there is enough budget for them to travel to a TSA office on a regular basis. You’ll also need to ensure that they can video conference easily with their co-workers who work out of an office.
