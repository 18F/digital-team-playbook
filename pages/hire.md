Here are some ways you can improve and augment your agency's hiring process.  

##Authorities
**Hiring authorities.** There are several hiring authorities that you can use, which have been successfully used at other agencies. The following table outlines only a few of these options, and it is important to work collaboratively with human capital representatives to determine the best course(s) of action.

####Fellowship Programs - [Schedule A 213.3102 (r)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=5:1.0.1.2.22#se5.1.213_13102)

##Compensation

Most digital teams are hired at the highest levels for an agency (e.g. GS-14/15). This is critical because some members may take a pay cut to serve in the government.

###Approach

In advance, figure out the following: 

* What challenges exist within your organization around creating a team that is mostly comprised of GS-13s - GS-15s (or equivalent)? What are the options to overcome these challenges? 
* What level of leadership will the digital services team engage with, and ensure they represent similar senior levels to ensure recognition of their role and promote successful dialogue.

##Improving recruitment
Attracting the right candidates requires a multifaceted approach.  Reliance on one or two job boards, posting job descriptions that are difficult to read or relying on a small network of coworkers to get the word out are not effective ways to recruit and hire the right candidates for your team.  While sites like [USA Jobs](https://www.usajobs.gov) are one tool in your toolbox, they alone cannot compete with the barrage of hiring opportunities your best candidates are likely to both find on their own and through direct contact with recruiters.  Remember that to retain the best talent you'll want a highly-diverse candidate pool to choose from.  Some of your best candidates may have never considered a position in government, and part of the challenge will be attracting high-quality talent wherever they may be.

Tap into other networks.  Find where people congregte that you want to hire, and approach them there.

##Understand your agency's brand
Why would someone want to work for your agency?  Do you provide opportunities for data scientists that no one else does?  Do you work at a critical intersection between public policy and the future of your field?  How do you explain what you do others, and what is most interesting to them?  It's helpful to think about understanding why someone might be motivated to work with your agency, and how you can share this message quickly and effectively before their attention is drawn elsewhere.  Find ways to explain job-related tasks that helps applicants better understand what day-to-day duties might look like.  

##Working with a remote team
Consider allowing members of your digital services team to live away from Washington DC. This makes recruitment easier as many digital professionals may be unwilling to move away from the lives and homes they have established, especially given the fact that most digital service teams are term-limited commitments. Both 18F and CFPB have proved that this model works successfully, however also be transparent in the need for some physical presence and plan for travel and tools (e.g. remote conferencing) as necessary. 

Ensure that there is a policy that allows them to have duty station away from an established office. 
Ensure that there is enough budget for them to travel to a TSA office on a regular basis. You’ll also need to ensure that they can video conference easily with their co-workers who work out of an office. 

##Hiring Time
Find out how long, on average it takes your agency to recruit and hire new staff.  Talk to your human resources representatives to find out ways to shorten this window.  Select candidates will not always be in a position to wait months before starting work. In order to be competitive, it’s critical that the time between application, interview, offer and start date be significantly reduced. So it’s important to shorten the time between recruitment and onboarding as much as possible. Weeks, not months is an acceptable time frame.
