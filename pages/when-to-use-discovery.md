Discovery is a process by which a government agency (you) can work with another government agency (us) to help identify, assess, address and understand a particular challenge you’re dealing with or a new project you are beginning to define.

Discovery can take many different forms depending on the set of tasks it’s trying to help you address, but there are some similar characteristics to most processes.  They include:

1. Lowering the risk of identifying the wrong scope for your project or challenge;
2. Addressing stakeholder needs and desires early in the process;
3. Accelerating buy-in by stakeholders throughout the project;
4. Training users on the value of the user research process; and
5. How to avoid planning your project around misaligned assumptions.

Working together as a team, we help you gain insight into the reference point for your project, identifying the “true north” for a particular challenge or set of goals.  This in turn helps you make better informed decisions, understand where and when to take calculated risks, and figure out the next, concrete steps towards making your project a success.

Once the next steps have been identified and agreed upon, 18F Consulting will help you figure out the next steps of the engagement and keep the project on-track to maintain the momentum of your new group of project stakeholders. 

##Who should participate from my organization, and what will we do?
18FC believes in cross-functional teams. Although design researcher/prod strategists may plan and lead product focused discovery sprints, anyone on a team, as a consultant, should feel confident planning and executing on interview and assessment based discoveries. And if you don’t yet, know that your team supports you getting that experience: through pairing, shadowing, and other activities.  Below are a few activities that often make up the discovery process.

###Stakeholder and Program Engagement
Generally consisting of a workshop format held over multiple days, stakeholder and program engagement activities are designed to figure out the situation unique to your organization and project that will help make your outcomes as useful as possible.  Activities include identification of all stakeholders that hold influence over a project and gaining insight into what they expect from the project; understanding fears and ideas around what success looks like; current or future policy decisions or laws that may impact certain directions for the project; identification of needs and vehicles for procurement with the acquisitions team; identification of current strengths, weaknesses and aspirations for the project.
###Research
Research occurs throughout the discovery process.  Background research provides a window into past success and failures, current systems and architecture, past user research and results, and any other reported findings that help inform the current state and the desired future state.  A history of an existing project including past management practices and methodology, assessments, contractor performance indicators, and previously identified metrics for success are helpful in framing a better understanding of the environment the team is working in.
###User Interviews
User interviews are an extremely valuable and reliable part of understanding the needs of your team.  Interviews usually take place in pairs.  Any more than two interviewers on an interview team tends to make users feel uncomfortable, and having two helps to vet the feedback and reduce risk of misunderstanding the experience.  Together the team helps to cross-check each finding and derive the most meaningful insights.

User interviews can also be complemented through direct observation.   Direct observation allows the team to shadow users working with a particular project or through a process and record observations about their interactions.  This helps inform the team how the current solution is (or isn’t being used), while also identifying opportunities for improving processes.

My colleagues insight and support where valuable to me and it gave another person inside the larger 18F organization a “high touch, client facing” experience.”  - Jesse Taggert, 18F Consulting
